I'm a Software Engineer from Italy.

I'm interested in web applications, databases (PostgreSQL specifically) and
everything cloud-related and have been working in these areas for many years.

I mostly work with Python and Go but I always like to learn new languages.

I'm an open source enthusiast and Linux user since many years.
