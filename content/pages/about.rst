I'm Alberto Donato, a Software Engineer from Italy.

I' interested in web applications, databases (PostgreSQL specifically) and
everything cloud-related and have been working in these areas for many years.

I mostly work with Python and Go but always like to learn new languages.

I'm an open source enthusiast and Linux user since many years.
