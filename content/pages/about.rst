:index: 0

I'm Alberto Donato, and I'm a Software Engineer from Italy.

I work at Canonical_ on the MAAS_ team.

I mostly work with Python, which I love because it helps to write clean and
concise code, but I also like to try out different languages.  I also use Go
and have done development in C in the past.

I'm interested in web applications, databases (PostgreSQL specifically) and
everything cloud-related, but also embedded systems (I have been working on
Linux kernel drivers and operating system-level tools in the past).

I'm an open source enthusiast and Linux user since many years.
